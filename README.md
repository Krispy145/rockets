# Rockets App

This Flutter project is a simple application that demonstrates how to fetch data from different endpoints using APIs. It provides information about rockets and missions. The app is designed to showcase proper state management using Flutter's BLoC pattern and dependency injection.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a starting point for learning Flutter app development and showcases the following features:

- Fetching data from APIs.
- Using BLoC pattern for state management.
- Implementing dependency injection for managing application dependencies.

## API Endpoints

The app interacts with the following API endpoints:

1. `GET /rockets`: Retrieves a list of rockets.
2. `GET /rockets/{id}`: Retrieves details of an individual rocket.
3. `GET /missions`: Retrieves a list of missions.
4. `GET /missions/{id}`: Retrieves details of an individual mission.

## App Features

- View a list of rockets and missions.
- Tap on a rocket or mission to view detailed information.
- Basic error handling and loading indicators.

## Project Details

- The project demonstrates a solid architecture and setup.
- It utilizes the BLoC pattern for efficient state management.
- Dependency injection is used to manage application dependencies.
- The app is designed to be scalable and performant.

## Known Issues and Improvements

- State handling when navigating back from individual rocket/mission pages needs further work.
- Error messages from repositories can be improved for better user feedback.
- Future improvements may include enhanced UI/UX, additional features, and optimizations.
- The project to be set up for CI/CD using CodeMagic. 

## Development Details

- Total development time: 6 hours.
